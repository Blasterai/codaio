### Installation
```shell script
pip install codaio
```

### Config via environment variables
The following variables will be called from environment where applicable:

* `CODA_API_ENDPOINT` (default value `https://coda.io/apis/v1beta1`)
* `CODA_API_KEY` - your API key to use when initializing document from environment

### Quickstart
You can initialize a document by providing API_KEY and document_id directly, or by storing your API key in environment under `CODA_API_KEY`

```python
from codaio import Document


# Directly
doc = Document('YOUR_DOC_ID', 'YOUR_API_KEY')

# From environment
>>> doc = Document.from_environment('YOUR_DOC_ID')
>>> print(doc)
Document(id='YOUR_DOC_ID', name='Document Name', owner='owner@example.com', browser_link='https://coda.io/d/URL')

>>> doc.tables()
[Table(name='Table1'), Table(name='table2')]

>>> doc.find_table('Table1')
Table(name='Table1')

>>> table.columns
[Column(name='First Column', calculated=False)]

>>> table.rows
[Row(name='Some row', index=1)]

# Find row by column name and value:
>> table.find_row_by_column_name_and_value('COLUMN_NAME', 'VALUE')
Row(name='Some row', index=1)

# Find row by column id and value
>>> table.find_row_by_column_id_and_value('COLUMN_ID', 'VALUE')
Row(name='Some row', index=1)

# To get cell value for a column use getitem:
>>> row['Column 1']
Cell(column=Column 1, row=Some row, value=Some Value)
```

#### Using raw API

`codaio` implements all methods of raw api in a convenient python manner. So API's `listDocs` becomes in `codaio` `Coda.list_docs()`. Get requests return a dictionary. Put, delete and post return a requests Response object.

### Coda
```python
Coda(self, api_key: 'str', href: 'str' = 'https://coda.io/apis/v1beta1') -> None
```

Raw API client. It is used in `codaio` objects like Document to access the raw API endpoints. Can also be used by itself to access Raw API.

:param url: The browser link to try to resolve. Example: "https://coda.io/d/_dAbCDeFGH/Launch-Status_sumnO"

:param degrade_gracefully: By default, attempting to resolve the Coda URL of a deleted object will result in an error.
If this flag is set, the next-available object, all the way up to the doc itself, will be resolved.
